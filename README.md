## Compose based chat app

This is my second ever modern Android application, based on Kotlin, View-Model-ViewModel and Jetpack Compose. For my first modern 
app, see [note-composer](https://github.com/Gtomika/note-composer).

Using Firebase as a backend for authentication and storage.

## Not intended for Google Play Store

This is a small scale app, intended for family-only use, and not to be deployed on Google Play Store. 
It only has hungarian language support.

## Build

To build this app, you must set up Firebase, and copy your *google-services.json* file to the *app* folder. Furethermore, 
your Firebase project must have **Blaze** plan, since this project uses Cloud Functions.
